        /*TODO: Some things to check with Stroud on, to see which rules he wants us to use:
            1. The rules say that advanced players can combine the build and trade phase. Do we do that?
            2. The rules say something different than him on collecting resources from settlements placed in the initial rounds
            3. Are you allowed to move the robber to the desert?
            4. Are you allowed to steal nothing from a player with no resources?
            5. If the bank is with like 1 or 2 of a resource and multiple people roll on a tile to get resources???

            Please add any more questions yall have here so we can fix them and not get yeeted
