            1. The rules say that advanced players can combine the build and trade phase. Do we do that?
            2. The rules say something different than him on collecting resources from settlements placed in the initial rounds
            3. Are you allowed to move the robber to the desert?

            Please add any more questions yall have here so we can fix them and not get yeeted
